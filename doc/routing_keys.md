# Routing keys

A routing key is a concept that originates from RabbitMQ: it allows you to let particular groups of messages be routed
to specific queues, which may then be consumed by dedicated consumers.

Whether or not you use RabbitMQ, you might need the concept of a routing key somewhere in your application. This
library contains an interface `RoutingKeyResolver` and two very simple standard implementations of it:

1. The `ClassBasedRoutingKeyResolver`: when asked to resolve a routing key for a given `Message`, it takes the full
class name of it and replaces `\` with `.`.
2. The `EmptyRoutingKeyResolver`: it always returns an empty string as the routing key for a given `Message`.
