# Additional properties

"Additional properties" is a concept that originates from RabbitMQ: it allows you to add metadata or otherwise configure
a message before it is sent to the server.

Whether or not you use RabbitMQ, you might need these additional (message) properties somewhere in your application.
This library contains an interface `AdditionalPropertiesResolver` and one implementation of that interface, the
`DelegatingAdditionalPropertiesResolver` which accepts an array of `AdditionalPropertiesResolver` instances. It lets
them all step in and provide values:

```php
use SimpleBus\Asynchronous\Properties\DelegatingAdditionalPropertiesResolver;
use SimpleBus\Asynchronous\Properties\AdditionalPropertiesResolver;

class MyPropertiesResolver implements AdditionalPropertiesResolver
{
    public function resolveAdditionalPropertiesFor($message)
    {
        // determine which properties to use

        return [
            'content-type' => 'application/xml'
        ];
    }
}

$delegatingResolver = new DelegatingAdditionalPropertiesResolver(
    [
        new MyPropertiesResolver(),
        ...
    ]
);

// $message is some message (e.g. a command or event)
$message = ...;

$properties = $delegatingResolver->resolveAdditionalPropertiesFor($message);
```
